Welcome! I’m Jorge García Ponce, a senior at Harvard College concentrating in Physics and Mathematics. My academic journey has been driven by a deep curiosity about the quantum world and a passion for understanding how quantum information can reshape our understanding of computation and the universe.

On this site, you’ll find more about my research, academic interests, and ongoing projects. Feel free to reach out — I'm always excited to connect with others interested in quantum information, teaching, and building a more inclusive scientific community.
